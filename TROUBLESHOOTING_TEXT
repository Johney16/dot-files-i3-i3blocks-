PREFACE:

I should start out by saying that I am a noob when it comes it i3 and i3blocks. I had a fair amount of difficulty with obscure problems that had
simple solutions.I also have a tendency to forget how I solved some of these problems, and so I am writing this as if I were talking to myself. 

Below I have compiled a list of tips and solutions for i3/i3blocks configuration here, in hopes that it may help someone else.
If something that I have written is incorrect or an undeal solution, please make a comment so that I can fix it.

TROUBLESHOOTING:

i3 main config $ I3 blocks,

#TROUBLESHOOTING. 
#some functions require additional Packages: xbacklight (illumination control), amixer (sound control) ,scrot (screenshot), feh, (?).
#other functions may be found in default ubuntu 16.x libraries?
#
#in order to get some LaTex libraries to load (soul.sty, or classicthesis.sty)- easiest way is to just download the large package: texlive-latex-extra
#
#ICONS via FontAwesome
#
#For icons/symbols. Download fontawesome package. unpack it. move it to /usr/share/fonts/
#yes, move the entire FontAwesome folder into the fonts directory. that is all.
#then write the following code in the  [bar] area font pango:DroidSans, FontAwesome 9
#
#lastly, copy and paste the actual icon that you want from the font awesome page here- or in i3blocks/or whatever bar. wherever you are implementing.
#https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/
#
#NOTE! some icon (such as "music" notes) copy/paste as a code 'fi'. This is okay. just refresh i3, and take a look.
#
#Make sure the workspace you want to add a label to is closed. OR: take note of next line.
#
# use terminal commands 'xev' to discover the name of keys. 'xprop' to deterine class name of programs. 'which' [program_name] to find location of program.
#
#Blocklets and Script troubleshooting for i3blocks may be found in the u3blocks.conf.
#
# Additional troubleshooting tips may be found directly above individual commands, in this file.


# MultiMonitor - Presentation modes: CODE to copy into Terminal!
#
#Terminal Code:  Same output/screen
# xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --same-as LVDS1
#
#  - Different output/screen
## xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 1024x768 --right-of LVDS1





# Pulse Audio controls
exec pacmd set-card-profile 0 output:analog-stereo
#Current Bindings using keyboard's specific media buttons
# volume controls
bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec amixer -q  set Master playback 5%+ unmute
bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec amixer -q  set Master playback 5%- unmute

#Mute command below isn't recommend. doesn't toggle. need to open pavucontrol to rectify
#bindsym XF86AudioMute exec amixer -q set Master mute toggle

#If Media keys are looking strange with 'xev' use this command to see what is going on: bindsym XF86AudioMute exec amixer -q set Master mute


#PRE 16.04.01 - some issue with pulseaudio changes and amixer made these obsolete
#bindsym XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec --no-startup-id pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- +5% #increase sound volume
#bindsym XF86AudioLowerVolume exec --no-startup-id pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- -5% #decrease sound volume
#bindsym XF86AudioMute exec --no-startup-id pactl #set-sink-mute 0 toggle # mute sound

## Current Screen brightness controls - make sure to apt-get xbacklight?
bindsym Home exec xbacklight -inc 10 # increase screen brightness
bindsym End exec xbacklight -dec 10 # decrease screen brightness

#ICONS via FontAwesome

#For icons/symbols. Download fontAwesome package. unpack it. move it to /usr/share/fonts/

#yes, move the entire FontAwesome folder into the fonts directory. that is all.

#then write the following code in the  [bar] area font pango:DroidSans, FontAwesome 9 - this enabled fonts for the bar.

#Have not needed to write that code in this file - labels are showing up in workspaces just fine.
#
#lastly, copy and paste the actual icon that you want from the font awesome page. INTO.the label of i3blocks/or wherever you are implementing.
#https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/
#
#NOTE! some icon (such as "music" notes) copy/paste as a code 'fi'. This is okay. just refresh i3 and take a look.
#
#
#When renaming/labeling workspaces:
#Make sure the workspace you want to add a label to is closed. - or just click navigate to the old label and close running applications there
#This sounds strange, but after $mod+r, give the icons some time to appear... or just restart the computer.
#
#
# CREATING SYSTEM KEY BINDINGS
#
# use terminal commands 'xev' to discover the name of keys. 'xprop' to deterine class name of programs.
#
#
# 
#Host i3 config file isn't directing to correct i3block config file. similar to next comment.
#make sure bar is pointing to the correct i3blocks folder. 
#
#  i3 blocks Command - make sure that is pointing to the correct location!
#
#"command", on this page below, wasn't pointing to the correct directory - there were two i3blocks folders. one was erroneous.
#
#
#
#Solution:
#OLD LOCATION
#command=/usr/local/libexec/i3blocks/$BLOCK_NAME
#
#CURRENT Correct- NEW LOCATION
#command=/home/john/i3blocks/blocklets/$BLOCK_NAME
#
# IN BLOCKLETS and SCRIPTS - make sure to set permission to execute. This can be found in properties.
#Each blocklet file (e.g. bluetooth) need execute permission.
